Additional libraries used:
- BNFC (most of the Main.hs is basically taken from the file autogenerated in there)
- unordered-containers for the HashSet (collection of the variables in the first compiler pass)
- mtl for the State Monad (used for keeping the next available register in the LLVM compiler)
